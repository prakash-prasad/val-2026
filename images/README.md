# Images for Infinite Love

Place your custom images in this folder using these filenames:

| Filename           | Stage                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| stage1.gif         | Opening / adventure start           |
| stage2_romantic.gif| Romantic path (You chose love)      |
| stage2_playful.gif | Playful path (Playing hard to get)  |
| stage_yes_bridge.gif | Extra stage before "Yes" ending  |
| no_stage_1.gif     | First "No" stage                    |
| no_stage_2.gif     | Second "No" stage                   |
| no_stage_3.gif     | Third "No" stage                    |
| no_stage_4.gif     | Fourth "No" stage                   |
| no_stage_5.gif     | Fifth "No" stage                    |
| ending_yes.gif     | Celebration screen (confetti)       |
| ending_no.gif      | Final "Try Yes instead?" screen     |

**Supported formats:** `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.png`

If you use a different extension (e.g. `stage1.jpg`), update the `image` field for that node in `story.js`.

Until you add local images, the app uses built-in fallback images automatically.
